### Kyle Vance

My interests revolve around data and data systems.

Most recently I've had experience building systems around Entity Resolution/Record Linkage and using LLMs for using Natural Language to query databases.

I've built with Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, LLMs/Machine Learning.

Additionally, I run my own [homelab](https://github.com/Vethorm-homelab) that focuses on open source software. I host various sites and systems for myself, friends, and family!
